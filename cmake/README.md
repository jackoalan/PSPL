Using CMake With PSPL
=====================

The [CMake build system](http://www.cmake.org) is used in many
ways throughout PSPL. Since PSPL is designed as a modular system,
CMake is used to control the specific features and configurations
desired for a given PSPL build. Once built, a series of macros are
published in a CMake package. These macros may be used to build a
scalable project around PSPL. Due to this setup, CMake may be 
leveraged by PSPL *developers* and *users* alike.
