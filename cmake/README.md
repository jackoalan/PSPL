Using CMake With PSPL
=====================

The [CMake build system](http://www.cmake.org) is used in many
ways throughout PSPL. It may be leveraged by PSPL *developers*
and *users* alike.


Building PSPL
-------------

Both the *toolchain* and *runtime* portions of PSPL may be built
using CMake. The `CMakeLists.txt` file-chain in PSPL's codebase
is quite configurable with a variety of options to select the toolchain
and runtime features desired. It also provides a simple means for 
the developer to select which graphics APIs should be supported
for the produced runtime.
