XCF Document Support
====================

To provide the same level of integration as TextureManager's PSD extension,
the **XCF extension** provides the same functionality for layered image 
documents produced by [GIMP](http://gimp.org). This allows digital artists 
to use an *entirely free and open source* art pipeline.
