PMDL Data Generation
====================

Since PMDL aims to provide *efficient runtime performance*, a great
deal of pre-processing work needs to be done on the source mesh data.
Vertex-format, rigging-structure (`PAR1` only) and mesh-topology all 
need to be accounted for in order to build concise vertex buffers and
drawing-indices.


Blender's Data
--------------

Since **Blender** is being used as PMDL's initial data-production tool,
what kind of data does it store internally for model data?


### Mesh ###

#### Polygon ####

#### Vertex ####


### Armature ###

#### Vertex Group ####

#### Bone ####
