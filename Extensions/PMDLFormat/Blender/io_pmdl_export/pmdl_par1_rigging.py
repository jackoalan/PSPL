PMDL Export Blender Addon
By Jack Andersen <jackoalan@gmail.com>

This file defines the `pmdl_par1_rigging` class to iteratively construct
a Skinning Info Section for `PAR1` PMDL files. Used by draw-format 
generators to select an optimal skin entry for a draw primitive,
or have a new one established.
