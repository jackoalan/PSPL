PSPL Toolchain
==============

The **Toolchain** portion of PSPL includes development tools
necessary to *compile* and *package* PSPL source intermediates.
Just like the *PSPL Runtime*, the *PSPL Toolchain* may be extended
to support new functionality end-to-end. 

The toolchain shares the same extension namespace as the runtime,
so extensions may be written to extend both at the same time.
